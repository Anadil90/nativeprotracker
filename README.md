# Native Pro Tracker

### "My Pitch"

I'm thrilled to introduce Native Pro Tracker, my innovative, scalable mobile app set to revolutionize task and product management. Capitalizing on the power of Google Cloud, Firebase, and Firestore DB, I've created an app that offers real-time data handling and top-notch security. My solution is hosted on Firebase and served via a Google Kubernetes cluster, delivering high-performance user experiences across a range of devices. I've acquired the domain through Namecheap, reinforcing my commitment to reliability and user satisfaction. Still in its beta stage but brimming with potential, I'm on a mission to redefine intuitive, full-stack task tracking for today's mobile world.
